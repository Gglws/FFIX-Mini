# FFIX-Mini

## Purpose
<p>This project was created to get more comfrotable using React while creating something fun! Final Fantasy 9 was one of my favorite games as a kid, 
so I wanted to create a similar game that uses the turn-based fighting system.</p>

## Tools used
JavaScript, React, React-DOM, Snowpack, PostgresSql, Express

## Features
### Bosses
* Players can fight through 10 rounds of bosses to complete the game. 
* Player gains a level after each round, increasing the player's combat stats.
### User Interface
* Buttons to save character in the database, load characters from the database, or restart. 
* Players have options to either attack the boss or use a potion to heal during the fight. 
### Support Character
* Support character has a chance to buff the player each round, however they may be killed by the boss!
